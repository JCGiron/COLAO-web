The Coleoptera **Anatomy Ontology Project** aims to integrate information about the anatomy and morphology of beetles across the order. 
We will tackle this by creating a Protégé-based ontology (https://protege.stanford.edu/) of commonly used terms for taxonomic descriptions of beetles, accompanied by a referenced and illustrated glossary.
