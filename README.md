The Coleoptera **Anatomy Ontology Project** aims to integrate information about the anatomy and morphology of beetles across the order.  
We will tackle this by creating a Protégé-based ontology ([https://protege.stanford.edu/](https://protege.stanford.edu/)) of commonly used terms for taxonomic descriptions of beetles, accompanied by a referenced and illustrated glossary.
